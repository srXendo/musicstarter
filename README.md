**🎵 MusicStarter**

MusicStarter is an online collaborative music player, built with Node.js (v20.19.4) on the backend and Angular on the frontend.
It allows users to create rooms where multiple listeners can enjoy the same song in sync — if one user pauses, resumes, or changes the track, it updates instantly for everyone connected.
